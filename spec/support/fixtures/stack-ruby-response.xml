We are actively working to transform our infrastructure into an agile and automated foundation for accelerated growth. It takes creativity and skill to weave diverse vendors and hardware features into the functionality our customers have come to depend on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will love many of the things that we love, such as: automating processes, streamlining delivery, deploying new core functionality, and building great tools that are a joy to use. Having a solid Linux, and operations background is helpful but so is a desire to work with developers, create robust tools, and help us improve processes around procurement and provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're a very fast growing company and we care about our culture.

If you love building highly available products and sharing your experience with others, you will enjoy helping us take our platform to the next level of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our engineers are particularly smart, creative, hard-working, and capable collaborators. They need leadership, not supervision. Management at NR leads by example. Managers here help engineers ship great features and tools by providing resources, eliminating blockers, and keeping folks informed. If you're a command-and-control person, this is not the right place for you. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you've been a lead software engineer or better a production operational expert yourself, and you love helping other engineers excel and manage projects working with engineers and business users, we might be the perfect place. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Management here is serious business. We have the best management-mentoring program in any SaaS company -- perhaps the best, period. It is hard work. Your job is to pave the way for engineers to do great things and lead projects across organizations. That could mean sitting in meetings so that engineers don't have to; working with other leaders to keep focus and without repeated changes helping engineers to stay focus and deliver; it could mean coaching an engineer all night through their first big conference presentation. It means whatever it takes to help our engineers ship great features, constantly level up--and have fun doing it! (Of course, you'll have fun too.) &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We're a very fast growing software company and we care about our culture.

Our customers love ALEX because he helps their employees figure out what&amp;rsquo;s best for their personal situations, which, in turn, saves our customers a boat-load of time and money - everybody wins! As we sell more and more of ALEX, we need more and more non-virtual (i.e., real life) people to keep the product amazing. That&amp;rsquo;s where you come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THAT'S LOVELY... BUT WHAT'S THE JOB?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love developers who can turn their hand to both server code and browser code. What we&amp;rsquo;re looking for, right now, are developers who have a few years under their belts and who are looking for an opportunity to work with great people, play with some great technology and build great products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d be working on our products, adding new features and fixing bugs (what?! bugs? never!). You'll also be expected to get involved in design discussions about how best to build and test the features that we need. Since we're following the Scrum process for creating our products, you're going to have an important voice in our product creation very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a background in software development. We don&amp;rsquo;t really care whether you got that by completing a Computer Science degree, through freelancing after attending a BootCamp or have been writing code on your Commodore since you were a kid. A background in development and a few years of professionally developing is what we want to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our client code is written in (surprise!) JavaScript. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for developers who have experience writing JavaScript web applications and using at least one well known library or framework - you know: Angular, Backbone, whatever. (We use React, so experience with that is a plus.) And terms like NPM, Bower, Grunt, and Gulp should sound familiar to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our server code is written in Ruby and we're looking for engineers with good experience with that. We're not beholden to any frameworks here; we've worked with Rails and we've worked with Grape. What's more important to us is solid fundamentals and an understanding of the pros and cons of using frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be the kind of person who tests their code, whether that's TDD-style or writing them after the fact, and you should know your way around a test running suite or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'd also expect you to have some experience using a source control management system. We use Git at Jellyvision, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve got your hands dirty with SVN and you&amp;rsquo;re ready for something new, we&amp;rsquo;re open to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We particularly love applicants who have had experience working with others writing code. Development is a team effort here at Jellyvision and we definitely want to know that you can roll with that and do well in a collaborative environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICE TO HAVES...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use Scrum to develop our products. If you have experience with Scrum, that&amp;rsquo;s one less thing we have to teach you (but we&amp;rsquo;re more than happy to teach it to you, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s done a modicum of Web development will have written CSS. If you&amp;rsquo;ve also used Less or Sass, that&amp;rsquo;s a bonus, but not critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use both SQL and NoSQL databases at Jellyvision. While it&amp;rsquo;ll be a rare day that you&amp;rsquo;re crafting raw database queries, experience with systems like MySQL or CouchDB will definitely be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re really trying to get there with Test Driven Development (or, at least, variants of TDD). To be honest, if you have experience in that, you might be bringing something to teach us. That would be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ABOUT THOSE NOT-TECHNICAL, BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT SKILLS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We&amp;rsquo;re looking for folks with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A passion for learning and experimenting with new technologies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working in a team-based environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great communication skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good eye (this isn't an art or design position, but it never hurts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;And, last but not least, a sense of humor. It just makes you more fun to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHEW. THAT WAS A LOT. ANYTHING ELSE?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&amp;nbsp; We only hire nice, bright, funny people who are willing to work hard.&amp;nbsp; Jellyvision is a group effort and you must be capable of working collaboratively with creative, technical, and project management types.&amp;nbsp; Everyone at Jellyvision shares a commitment to excellence and a desire to work in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;ARE THERE ANY PERKS?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yes, we love perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competitive pay, stock options and benefits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;401(k) with matching.&amp;nbsp; And we pay 100% of the cost of premiums for medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance for our employees (as long as you qualify for our tobacco-free discount; if you&amp;rsquo;re a tobacco user, your medical premiums will be higher than $0). We also cover a really nice chunk of the cost of premiums for spouse/partner/dependent medical, dental and vision insurance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Casual dress and a flexible schedule.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Come in a sweatshirt, jeans, whatever, like everyone else here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creative work environment.&amp;nbsp;We are lucky to work in a place that is full of intelligent, talented and innovative folks. Although most hours the place is deathly quiet (we're a focused bunch), this is punctuated with hilarious outbursts and general merriment, which makes a nice way to spend the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easy transportation.&amp;nbsp;We&amp;rsquo;re really close to the "L" and the Halsted (#8) bus (right by the new Apple Store and Mega Whole Foods if that&amp;rsquo;s your kind of thing), and we have a transit FSA that allows you to dedicate pre-tax dollars to public transportation expenses.&amp;nbsp; Since a number of our employees like to bike to work, we also have showers and lockers in the office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did we mention our yoga class?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We bring a pro instructor right to the office.&amp;nbsp;Fully subsidized by Jellyvision and fully optional, btw.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh! And you should know that we have a massage chair. And not just any massage chair, my friend.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s the HumanTouch HT 5320 WholeBody&amp;trade; Massage Chair. Feeling a little stiff? Sit down. Relax. Feel better? Good. Okay, back to work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free food.&amp;nbsp;Every week, we stock our kitchen with free healthy snack foods, and we have a &amp;ldquo;hot lunch&amp;rdquo; catered once a week to give people a reason to hang out and eat together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERESTED?&amp;nbsp;GREAT!

We make better, more usable tools for teaching and learning (you know, stuff people will actually use). A better connected and more open education technology ecosystem.
